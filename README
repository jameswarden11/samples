## James Warden - 2016
## Hello, and thank you for checking out my GitHub samples.
## The following PHP files are as follows:
## friends.php - mini-social networking section of root2020.com
## datafeed.php - functions that work with the calendar on root2020.com
## gps.php - gps functions that narrow location down to database entries
## index.php - a simple ebay resell script I threw together in about 10-15 minutes
## (try doing a search at ebayhunter.root2020.com)
##
## The following Linux file(s) are as follows:
## .bash_history
## 1) setting up a LAMP server from the command line on Fedora
## 2) ensuring the java virtual machine is set to the latest version (in case we need it)
## 3) configuring iptables for the new installation
